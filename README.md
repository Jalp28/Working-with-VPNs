## VPN Setup and Analysis Report

This report outlines the steps to set up and use free VPN clients (ProtonVPN free tier and Windscribe free) to explore their role in protecting privacy and securing communication. It includes setup instructions, connection verification, and a summary of benefits and limitations.

### Setup Steps for Free VPN Clients

1. **Choose a Reputable Free VPN Service and Sign Up**:
   - **ProtonVPN**: Visit [protonvpn.com](https://protonvpn.com) and sign up for the free tier (no payment required, email needed).
   - **Windscribe**: Go to [windscribe.com](https://windscribe.com) and create a free account (10GB/month with email verification, 2GB without).

2. **Download and Install the VPN Client**:
   - **ProtonVPN**: Download the client for your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS) from the official website and follow the installation prompts.
   - **Windscribe**: Download the app from the website or app store, then install it on your device.

3. **Connect to a VPN Server**:
   - **ProtonVPN**: Open the app, log in, and select a server (e.g., Netherlands or US) from the free tier options (five countries available).
   - **Windscribe**: Launch the app, log in, and connect to a nearby server (e.g., US, Canada, or UK) from the free server list.

4. **Verify Your IP Address Has Changed**:
   - Visit [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) before and after connecting.
   - **Result**: IP changes to the VPN serverâ€™s location (e.g., from India to Netherlands), confirming the connection.

5. **Browse a Website to Confirm Traffic Is Encrypted**:
   - Open a site like [google.com](https://google.com) or [bbc.com](https://bbc.com).
   - **Observation**: Pages load securely, and no unencrypted traffic alerts appear (e.g., HTTPS lock icon present).

6. **Disconnect VPN and Compare Browsing Speed and IP**:
   - Disconnect from the VPN in the app.
   - **Result**: IP reverts to your original (e.g., Indian ISP IP), and browsing speed may increase slightly (e.g., 5-10% faster without encryption overhead).

7. **Research VPN Encryption and Privacy Features**:
   - **ProtonVPN**: Uses AES-256 encryption, OpenVPN/WireGuard protocols, no-logs policy, and Swiss privacy laws.
   - **Windscribe**: Employs AES-256, IKEv2/OpenVPN, no-logs policy, and offers a kill switch on free tier.
   - **Note**: Both mask IP addresses and encrypt traffic, enhancing privacy on public Wi-Fi.

8. **Write a Summary on VPN Benefits and Limitations**:
   - **Benefits**:
     - Protects privacy by hiding your IP and encrypting data.
     - Secures communication on public networks (e.g., cafes, airports).
     - Bypasses geo-restrictions for limited content access.
   - **Limitations**:
     - Free tiers have data caps (10GB for Windscribe, unlimited but server-limited for ProtonVPN).
     - Slower speeds due to encryption (5-25% drop).
     - Limited server options may affect performance or access.
     - No guarantee of full anonymity (relies on VPN provider trust).
